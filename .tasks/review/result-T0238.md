## Summary

Implemented warranty-app translation helpers for warranty titles, policy summaries, claim instructions, and coverage clauses in `app/services/integrations/index.ts`. Added integration tests covering translated warranty content and metadata preservation in `test/unit/integrations.test.ts`. Updated `CHANGELOG.md` with the new integration support and resolved the existing conflict markers in the Unreleased section on this branch.

⚠️ REMIX FUTURE CHANGE: The `@remix-run/eslint-config` package is deprecated and will not be included in React Router v7.  We recommend moving towards a streamlined ESLint config such as the ones included in the Remix templates. See https://github.com/remix-run/remix/blob/v2/templates/remix/.eslintrc.cjs.
