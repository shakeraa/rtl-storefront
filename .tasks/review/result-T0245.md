## Summary

Implemented currency-converter translation helpers for selector titles, base-currency labels, selector headings, and currency options in `app/services/integrations/index.ts`. Added integration tests covering translated currency app content and metadata preservation in `test/unit/integrations.test.ts`. Updated `CHANGELOG.md` with the new integration support and resolved the existing conflict markers in the Unreleased section on this branch.

⚠️ REMIX FUTURE CHANGE: The `@remix-run/eslint-config` package is deprecated and will not be included in React Router v7.  We recommend moving towards a streamlined ESLint config such as the ones included in the Remix templates. See https://github.com/remix-run/remix/blob/v2/templates/remix/.eslintrc.cjs.
